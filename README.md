# Ember: the Obsidian toolchain installer
Ember installs The Obsidian Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all platforms Obsidian supports, including Windows.
